# Provenance Ledger — descriptive-translation-reviewer

Canonical record of what grounds this subagent. The profile, skills, references, faithfulness
report, and tests are all derived from the distilled spine in this package
(`principles/principles.yaml` -> `analysis/claims.jsonl` -> `evidence/evidence-records.yaml` ->
`sources/anchors/*.anchors.jsonl`), assembled by the map->reduce build. No load-bearing profile rule
field is an orphan: every `quality_bar`, `forbidden_behaviours`, `handoff_rules`,
`knowledge_partition.always_on`, and `source_of_truth_policy` value cites the promoted principle(s)
it restates. (Descriptive fields — `role`, `when_to_use`, `inputs`, `outputs` — carry no inline
tags, per repo convention.)

All three sources are **distillation-only**: paraphrase and restructure only, no verbatim quotation
(see `.claude/rules/rights-and-quotation-policy.md`; enforced by `quote_scan`). They are canonical
descriptive-translation-studies works: Munday's survey of the discipline, Venuti's reader of primary
essays, and Toury's statement of the norms programme.

## Distillation

Spine: 180 promoted principles (P001-P180; 141 high-confidence) over
984 atomic claims, with evidence records and chunk anchors. The 180 principles are
partitioned across 12 skills, each principle owned by exactly one skill; the two
references index and ground them.

## Version History

- **1.0.0** (2026-07-12) — Initial LLM-authored layer over the pre-built distilled spine: profile
  (role, three modes, quality bar, forbidden behaviours, 12-skill / 2-reference
  knowledge partition), faithfulness report, 12 skills, 2 references, golden +
  principle-behaviour tests, and the exported Claude Code adapter. No prior profile decisions
  superseded.
