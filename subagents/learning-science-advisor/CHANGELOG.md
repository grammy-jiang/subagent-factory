# Changelog — learning-science-advisor

All notable changes to this generated subagent package are recorded here. Versions follow the
`agent_version` field in `profile.yaml`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-26

### Added
- Initial release of the **learning-science-advisor** subagent (Tier 2), authoring the LLM layer over the
  already-assembled, deterministically-valid distilled spine (150 principles
  P001-P150 / 5006 claims from twelve distillation-only sources).
- `profile.yaml` derived from the 150 promoted principles: role, when/when-not-to-use, three
  modes (advise / review / plan), quality bar, forbidden behaviours, handoff rules, and a
  15-skill / 2-reference `knowledge_partition` covering every principle exactly
  once.
- 15 authored skills partitioning all 150 principles; 2 references
  (principles index + evidence notes).
- `reports/faithfulness-report.yaml` — every load-bearing profile rule graded WITHIN_SCOPE against
  its principles (no rule stronger than its evidence; the sources' own hedging on far transfer,
  durability and classroom generality is carried through).
- `tests/golden-tests.yaml` (7 golden, 3 negative-routing,
  2 missing-context) and `tests/principle-behaviour-tests.yaml` (one behaviour test per
  principle, 150 total).
- Claude Code adapter exported to `adapters/claude-code/` and installed under
  `.claude/agents/generated/`.

### Fixed
- `sources/metadata/*.metadata.json`: `source_type` normalised from the map->reduce short form
  `md` to the schema enum value `markdown`.

### Grounding
- Twelve distillation-only sources: Dunlosky et al. (2013); *Make It Stick* (Brown, Roediger &
  McDaniel, 2014); *Understanding How We Learn* (Weinstein & Sumeracki, 2018); *Principles of
  Instruction* (Rosenshine, 2012); *How Learning Works* (Ambrose et al., 2010); *Why Don't Students
  Like School?* (Willingham, 2009); *Powerful Teaching* (Agarwal & Bain, 2019); *Small Teaching*
  (Lang, 2016); *Small Teaching Online* (Darby & Lang, 2019); *Visible Learning* (Hattie, 2008);
  *The Science of Learning* (Deans for Impact); and *How People Learn II* (NASEM, 2018).
